Simple DB Storage (for Django)
==============================

Its (almost always) a really bad idea to put files in your database, but if you're sure 
that is what you want to do, here is some code that you can use.

Use SimpleDatabaseStorage for straight database storage, CachedDatabaseStorage if you 
want to cache files in your cache as well, to try to make them faster. 

Good luck!!
